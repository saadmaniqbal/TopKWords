As Tom Steyer, the 62-year-old billionaire former hedge funder 
and impeachment impresario, made his first trip to Iowa as a 2020 candidate this month, 
he embarked on the usual political circuit.

He. delivered a soapbox speech at the 
state fair (“We have to break the corporate stranglehold on our democracy,” he said),
 visited the butter cow (“Not my first butter cow,” he corrected one fairgoer; 
 he had been last year), 
sipped lemonade and professed his desire to see farm animals.

What was unusual for a man who has never held
 elected office and been running for president for only a few weeks was that 
people kept recognizing him along the way.

“Hey, it’s the YouTube guy!” one woman shouted as Mr. Steyer strode past.

"He" is the television guy, too. Mr. 
Steyer has spent $12 million on digital and 
television ads in only six weeks — more than any other Democrat 
has spent all year — often featuring him speaking straight into the camera.

“Your commercials make sense,” John Brinkmeyer of Hubbard, 
Iowa, told him. “They’re not the ones I turn off,” said Mike Poe 
of Marshalltown, Iowa. Catherine Rondema almost squealed when she spotted Mr. Steyer. 
She had come to Des Moines all the way from Portland, Ore., and had timed her 
fair visit to hear him speak. “I appreciate his commercials,” she explained.
